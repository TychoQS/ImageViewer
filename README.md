# Image Viewer
## Summary
A program that displays images from a specified directory, and allows the user to navigate between them. The code includes some images stored in a directory for running the application.
## Functionalities
In addition to displaying images, the program allows the user to perform the following actions:
- **Display the next or previous image of the directory.** This can be achieved by either **clicking the red arrows** at the bottom of the window or **by dragging** the images with the mouse, and then releasing the click, similar to how an smartphone gallery works.
- **Enlarge the image** by scrolling the mouse wheel, allowing images that are small to be expanded.
## Image formats supported
Image formats that the program is able to recognize for displaying are the following ones:
- *jpeg*
- *jpg*
